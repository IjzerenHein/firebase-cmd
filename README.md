# Firestore CMS

A free, flexible and easy to use CMS for Google Firestore ðŸŽ‰

This project is under development and not ready yet. This project primarily aims at providing an out of the box solution for managing your Firestore collections and documents.

## Installation

To install, add the package as a dev dependency:

`yarn add firestore-cms --dev`

## Setup

After that, initialize a default Firestore CMS configuration for your project.

`yarn firestore-cms init`

This will create a folder called `firestore-cms/` in your project
which contains the configuration files and generated output.

## Configuration

The configuration is stored in `firestore-cms/config.js`.
See [Configuration](/configuration) for all the setup options.

## Test & build

To test and debug, you can run a reloading dev server using:

`yarn firestore-cms start`

And use the following command to build a production build:

`yarn firestore-cms build`

This will generate a static website in `/firestore-cms/build`.
