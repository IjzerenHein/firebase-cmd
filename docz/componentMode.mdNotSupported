# Firebase CMS

A free, flexible and easy to use CMS for Google Firestore ðŸŽ‰

This project is under development and not ready yet. This project primarily aims at providing an out of the box solution for managing your Firestore collections and documents.

You can use the firebase CMS in two different modes. Either in standalone mode, which can run a dev server and generate a static website. Or in Component mode, in which you can integrate it into your existing React application.

## Standalone mode

To install, add the package as a dev dependency:

`yarn add firebase-cms --dev`

After that, create a configuration file called `firebase-cms.config.js` in the root of your project.
See [Configuration](/configuration) on how to create a configuration file.

`./firebase-cms.config.js`

To test and debug, you can run a live reloading dev server using:

`yarn firebase-cms dev`

And use the following command to build a production build:

`yarn firebase-cms build`

This will generate a static website in `/firebase-cms-build`.

## Component mode

Component mode offers a much higher degree of flexibility and the ability to integrate Firebase CMS or some of its components into your React application.

Install Firebase CMS a regular dependency:

`yarn add firebase-cms`

You can now import the components into your React application.

```js
import { AppView, SidebarView, CollectionView } from "firebase-cms";

ReactDOM.render(<AppView store={store} />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

[The components and their props are documented here](/components).
