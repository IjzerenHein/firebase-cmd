# Firestore CMS

A free, flexible and easy to use CMS for Google Firestore ðŸŽ‰

This project is under development and not ready yet. This project primarily aims at providing an out of the box solution for managing your Firestore collections and documents.

## Installation

To install, add the package as a dev dependency:

`yarn add firestore-cms --dev`

## Configuration

After that, create a configuration file called `firestore-cms.config.js` in the root of your project.
See [Configuration](/configuration) on how to create a configuration file.

`./firestore-cms.config.js`

## Test & build

To test and debug, you can run a reloading dev server using:

`yarn firestore-cms start`

And use the following command to build a production build:

`yarn firestore-cms build`

This will generate a static website in `/firestore-cms-build`.
